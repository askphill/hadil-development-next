# Contributing

We're really glad you're reading this, because we would love to have more developers contribute to this starter! If you have some ideas to improve this repo, we are all ears.

## Before contributing

If you encounter a bug or think of a useful feature for next-starter, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/askphill/next-starter/issues). Creating an issue before jumping into code ensures we can discuss it and determine whether it aligns with the direction of the starter.

Contributions aren't necessarily all code related. If you want to start a discussion not immediately tied to the code, please do so in our [Discussions](https://github.com/askphill/next-starter/discussions) tab!
